Why Choosing the Right Web Hosting Matters
Small businesses often operate on limited budgets and tight schedules. A poor web hosting service can lead to:

Slow-loading websites (which increases bounce rates)

Downtime during peak traffic

Security vulnerabilities

Limited customer support

All of which can negatively affect your online credibility and customer trust. That's why choosing a hosting solution tailored to your business needs is critical.
